Dineo – Android Restaurant Reservation & Ordering App
📱 Project Overview

Dineo is an Android-based restaurant management application designed to support guest users, registered customers, and restaurant staff. The app allows customers to browse menus, make and manage reservations, and update profiles, while staff can review, confirm, or reject reservations through a dedicated interface.

This project was developed as part of an academic coursework and demonstrates practical implementation of Android UI design, activity lifecycle management, data persistence, and role-based access control.
